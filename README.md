To run the corrider simulation
---
If you want to navigate robot in the crowd, you should try this.

1. Open padsim simulator in rviz
```bash
#terminal 1
sourcemars
roslaunch pedsim_simulator gym_crowd_environment.launch scene_file:=crossing_corridor.xml
```
2. Open gazebo
```bash
#terminal 2
sourcemars
roslaunch pedsim_gazebo_plugin crossing_corridor.launch
#terminal 3
roslaunch mars_lite_description spawn_mars.launch
```
3. Let pedestrian move in simulation
```bash
rosservice call /pedsim_simulator/unpause_simulation "{}"
```
4. Open pedestrian detection
```bash
#terminal 4
sourceyolo
roslaunch scan yolodetect.launch
```
5. Open amcl
```bash
#terminal 5
sourcemars
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation globalmap.launch
```
### Next part haven't been finished yet.
6. To navigate robot
```bash
#terminal 6 (path finding)
roslaunch path_finding astar_path_finding_with_social_proxemics.launch
sourcemars
#terminal 7 (path following)
sourcemars
roslaunch path_tracking path_tracking_autonomous.launch
```


Only open mars model
---
If you only want to open gazebo model in gazebo you can try this.
```bash
#terminal 1 (open gazebo in mars)
sourcemars
roslaunch mars_lite_description mars_gazebo.launch realsense_enabled:=true world:=world
#terminal 2 
sourcemars (see all state in rviz and open moveit)
roslaunch mars_lite_moveit_config mars_lite_moveit_planning_execution_gz.launch
```
